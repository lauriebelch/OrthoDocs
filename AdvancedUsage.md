# Advanced usage

## Manually installing dependencies

To run OrthoFinder3 on default setting, you will need diamond, famsa, fasttree, MCL

If you install OrthoFinder using a recommended method, you shouldnâ€™t need to install
any of the dependencies manually. 

If you do need to install anything manually, you will need to follow the instructions given by each software;

- [Diamond](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond)
- [FAMSA](https://github.com/refresh-bio/FAMSA)
- [FastTree](http://www.microbesonline.org/fasttree/#Install)
- [MCL](https://github.com/micans/mcl)

## Running BLAST searches separately

The ```-op``` option will prepare the files in the format required by OrthoFinder and print the set of BLAST commands to run.

```orthofinder -f fasta_files_directory -op```

This is useful if you want to manage the BLAST searches yourself. For example, you
may want to distribute them across multiple machines. Once the BLAST searches have
been completed the orthogroups can be calculated using the ``-b``` command (see below)

## Use pre-computed BLAST

It is possible to run OrthoFinder with pre-computed BLAST results provided they are in
the correct format. They can be prepared in the correct format using the ```-op``` command
and, equally, the files from a previous OrthoFinder run are also in the correct format to
rerun using the ```-b``` option. The command is simply:

```orthofinder -b directory_with_processed_fasta_and_blast_results```

If you are running the BLAST searches yourself it is strongly recommended that you
use the ```-op``` option to prepare the files first (see Section "Running BLAST Searches
Separately")
